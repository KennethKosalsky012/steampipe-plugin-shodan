## Building the Plugin

Install Steampipe:Â [Instructions](https://steampipe.io/downloads)

Clone repository:

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/turbot; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/turbot
$ git clone git@github.com:turbot/steampipe-plugin-shodan
```

Enter the plugin directory and build the plugin:

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-shodan
$ make
```

Copy configuration files from repo to local steampipe config:
```sh
$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-shodan/config/* ~/.steampipe/config
```

View and update the configuration file settings for your environment [see the plugin docs](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/shodan) for additional info:
```sh
$ pico ~/.steampipe/config/shodan.spc
```

## Using the Plugin

During the `make` process, the script will output the plugin to `~/.steampipe/plugins/hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/shodan@latest/` which is the default location for steampipe plugins. Restart Steampipe if already running. Then try a test query:

```sql
select * from shodan_host_service where ip = '8.8.8.8'
```

## Developing the Plugin

To add features to the Plugin, install [Go](http://www.golang.org) and configure your your [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)

Compile the Plugin by running `make`. The Plugin binary will output to your Steampipe plugin directory.

```sh
$ make
```
